    <!-- Objective Section -->
    <section id="objective" class="content-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>The objective of this project is to design a wireless sensor network (WSN) system that is energy-efficient and scalable using ESP32 boards and IoT protocols. The system is ideal for monitoring environmental parameters like temperature and humidity in real-time, providing solutions to common issues faced in industrial and domestic settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>In industrial and domestic settings, real-time monitoring and control of environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity are crucial for maintaining optimal conditions and ensuring safety. However, traditional monitoring systems often lack flexibility, real-time configurability, and effective communication protocols. This results in inefficiencies in data collection, delayed responses to alerts, and challenges in managing large-scale distributed systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>To address these challenges, the project integrates ESP-NOW for low-latency communication between nodes, MQTT for reliable remote monitoring, and DHT sensors for temperature and humidity data acquisition. The system is designed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Seamless Communication:</strong> Facilitate low-latency communication between multiple sensor nodes and a central bridge using ESP-NOW.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Configurability:</strong> Provide dynamic configuration through MQTT to adjust thresholds and intervals without manual intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Data Acquisition and Alerts:</strong> Continuously monitor temperature and humidity, triggering alerts based on threshold breaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Implement duty cycle management and deep sleep modes for battery-powered nodes, optimizing energy consumption.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The key focus areas are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Low power consumption for long-lasting battery life in remote areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the environmental data collected.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system should be easily expandable with more nodes for larger areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Fast and reliable data transmission through ESP-NOW and MQTT protocols.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- System Architecture Section -->
<section id="architecture" class="content-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">System Architecture</h2>
    <p>The system architecture consists of multiple sensor nodes, a central bridge node, and a cloud-based server or MQTT broker. The architecture is designed to enable efficient and reliable environmental monitoring with real-time data collection and alerting capabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>System Process Flow:</strong> Below is the flowchart that illustrates the step-by-step process of how the system operates, from data collection by sensor nodes to cloud-based monitoring:</p>
    <img src="./images/flowchart.jpeg" alt="System Process Flowchart" class="img-fluid mt-4">
    
    <p>The flowchart visually depicts how data flows from sensor nodes to the bridge node and eventually to the MQTT broker for remote monitoring.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sensor Nodes:</strong> Each sensor node is equipped with a DHT sensor (such as DHT11 or DHT22) to collect environmental data, specifically temperature and humidity. These sensor nodes are based on the ESP32 microcontroller and communicate with each other using the ESP-NOW protocol, which allows low-latency, peer-to-peer communication without the need for a traditional Wi-Fi network. The sensor nodes read data at predefined intervals and transmit the data to the bridge node. Additionally, the nodes are designed to optimize power consumption by utilizing deep sleep modes during idle periods, ensuring long-lasting battery life.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Bridge Node:</strong> The bridge node acts as an intermediary between the sensor nodes and the cloud server or MQTT broker. It receives data from multiple sensor nodes via ESP-NOW, processes the data, and forwards it to the cloud using the MQTT protocol. This ensures that the collected environmental data is made available for remote monitoring, visualization, and alerting. The bridge node is also responsible for managing the communication between the sensor nodes and ensuring that the data is transmitted reliably. It also performs some basic data validation to ensure the integrity of the transmitted information.</p>

    <p><strong>Central Server / MQTT Broker:</strong> The MQTT broker, hosted on a cloud platform or local server, is responsible for receiving and storing the data from the bridge node. It provides a communication hub for the sensor nodes and the bridge node. Using the MQTT protocol ensures that data is transmitted efficiently and securely. The central server monitors the incoming data for any irregularities or thresholds that exceed predefined limits. If an anomaly is detected (e.g., temperature or humidity levels that fall outside acceptable ranges), it triggers alerts, which can be sent to remote users or integrated with other systems for further action.</p>

    <p>This architecture is scalable, meaning additional sensor nodes can be added easily to expand coverage over larger areas. The system also supports flexible remote configuration through MQTT, allowing users to adjust the thresholds and polling intervals without needing direct physical access to the nodes.</p>

</section>


<!-- Software Implementation Section -->
<section id="software" class="content-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Software Implementation</h2>
    <p>The software implementation is divided into two main components: the sensor node code and the bridge node code. Each component plays a crucial role in collecting, transmitting, and receiving environmental data (such as temperature and humidity) across the system. Below is a detailed description of each part:</p>

    <h3>Sensor Node Code:</h3>
    <p>The sensor node code runs on the ESP32 microcontroller and is responsible for reading data from the environmental sensors (DHT11 or DHT22). The steps involved are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensor Data Collection:</strong> The sensor node is equipped with a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. The code reads these values at defined intervals, typically every few seconds or minutes, depending on the system’s configuration.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> After reading the data from the sensor, the ESP32 processes the raw sensor values. This may involve basic error checking, like verifying the validity of the data (e.g., checking for extreme temperature or humidity readings).</li>
        <li><strong>ESP-NOW Communication:</strong> The processed sensor data is then transmitted to a nearby bridge node using the ESP-NOW protocol. ESP-NOW is a low-latency, peer-to-peer communication protocol designed specifically for IoT applications, which helps in efficient data transmission between nodes without relying on a traditional Wi-Fi network.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep Mode:</strong> To conserve power, the sensor node is programmed to enter deep sleep mode between sensor readings, reducing energy consumption and extending battery life for long-term deployments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bridge Node Code:</h3>
    <p>The bridge node also runs on an ESP32 microcontroller. It acts as a relay station, collecting data from multiple sensor nodes and forwarding it to the central MQTT broker. The steps involved are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Reception:</strong> The bridge node receives data from multiple sensor nodes via the ESP-NOW protocol. It can handle multiple nodes simultaneously, acting as a central collector for sensor data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Forwarding:</strong> Once the bridge node receives the data, it packages the sensor readings into a format suitable for transmission over the MQTT protocol. The bridge node then forwards the data to the MQTT broker (either locally or in the cloud), where it can be accessed by the central monitoring system or dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> If the bridge node is unable to receive data or encounters issues with communication, it retries the transmission or alerts the system about the failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Power Management:</strong> Like the sensor nodes, the bridge node also utilizes sleep modes to conserve power, especially in battery-operated setups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Remote Configuration via MQTT:</h3>
    <p>Using MQTT, users can remotely configure the system. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Threshold Adjustment:</strong> Users can remotely change the temperature and humidity thresholds for triggering alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Interval Adjustment:</strong> The frequency of sensor readings and data transmission intervals can be adjusted remotely to optimize performance based on user needs or network conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-Time Data Monitoring:</h3>
    <p>Through the MQTT broker, real-time data from all sensor nodes is accessible via a central dashboard, where users can monitor temperature, humidity, and system health. The system provides live updates and allows users to track environmental parameters continuously.</p>

</section>
<section id="reflection" class="content-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Reflection: Problems Encountered; Solutions Adopted</h2>
    <p>Throughout the development of this IoT system, several challenges were encountered. Below is a summary of the main problems faced and the solutions implemented to overcome them:</p>

    <h3>1. Problem: Data Loss Between Sensor Nodes and Bridge Node</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> One of the main challenges was data loss during communication between the sensor nodes and the bridge node, especially when there were multiple sensor nodes trying to send data simultaneously.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To address this, the ESP-NOW communication protocol was optimized to handle multiple data packets more efficiently. We implemented a retry mechanism for data transmission and ensured proper error handling in case of communication failures. Additionally, the communication frequency was reduced to prevent congestion on the wireless network.</p>

    <h3>2. Problem: High Power Consumption in Sensor Nodes</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> The sensor nodes initially consumed more power than expected, which could lead to reduced battery life, especially in outdoor deployments where charging options are limited.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We adopted a deep sleep mechanism for the ESP32 microcontroller and optimized the duty cycle. The nodes were programmed to go into deep sleep mode between data readings to conserve energy. A more efficient power management strategy was developed to ensure that the system operated for extended periods on a single charge.</p>

    <h3>3. Problem: Latency in Data Transfer to the MQTT Broker</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> During initial testing, there was noticeable latency in data transmission between the bridge node and the MQTT broker. This delay was particularly evident when sending real-time sensor data.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To reduce the latency, the system architecture was optimized by fine-tuning the communication intervals between the bridge node and the MQTT broker. Additionally, the MQTT broker was configured for better message queuing and prioritization, ensuring faster message delivery.</p>

    <h3>4. Problem: Limited Range of ESP-NOW Communication</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> The communication range of the ESP-NOW protocol was initially limited, causing communication failures between sensor nodes and the bridge node when the nodes were placed far apart.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To extend the communication range, we placed the bridge node in a more central location within the deployment area and used external antennas for better signal reception. In cases where the range was still insufficient, additional repeater nodes were used to extend the network coverage.</p>

    <h3>5. Problem: System Scalability Issues with Increasing Nodes</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> As more sensor nodes were added to the system, there was a noticeable decrease in performance, including slower data processing and transmission delays.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Scalability was addressed by implementing a more efficient data-handling strategy on the bridge node. The system was also designed to support a hierarchical node structure, where nodes could forward data to intermediate nodes before reaching the bridge node. This significantly improved scalability and performance with multiple nodes in the system.</p>

    <h3>6. Problem: MQTT Broker Overload with Large Amounts of Data</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> The MQTT broker faced overload issues when handling large volumes of sensor data coming from multiple nodes. This caused delays in data processing and message delivery.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To alleviate this, the system was designed to send aggregated data from the sensor nodes at regular intervals instead of sending raw data continuously. The MQTT broker was also scaled horizontally to ensure better load distribution and improved data processing capabilities.</p>

    <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Proper error handling and data integrity checks are essential to ensure reliable communication between nodes.</li>
        <li>Energy-efficient designs are crucial for long-term operation, especially in remote or off-grid environments.</li>
        <li>Optimization of system performance and latency is key to real-time monitoring in IoT systems.</li>
        <li>Scalability must be considered from the beginning to ensure that the system can handle an increasing number of devices efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These challenges provided valuable insights into the complexities of developing an IoT system and have helped refine the approach to solving these issues. The solutions adopted not only resolved the immediate problems but also contributed to the overall robustness and reliability of the system.</p>
